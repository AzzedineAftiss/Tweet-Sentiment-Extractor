# ### Tweet Sentiment Extractor
In this notebook, I built a deep learning model that used ___ Roberta-Base___ as a backbone. The model outputs the feeling of the tweet (positive, negative, neutral) and also gives you the chosen sentence from the tweet that leads to that feeling.
Also at the end, the trained weights of the model were saved for  and inference . Given the tweet as input, the model is able to predict sentiment with the selected text.
